I first started my design by collecting all the assets that I needed to put into my website. Then I decided what pages should I add to my website. I used my design mock-up to create my website. I went step by step to every page and used a uniform design for all my web pages. The color scheme that I used was very simple but effective, as I used different shades of blue color to add to my site elements. I stuck to the basics first to create the main format of my HTML and CSS files and then later added extra stuff to it. It was a great experience creating my own portfolio. 
I faced a few challenges like dealing with flexbox and grid system while creating this website and its elements. But in the end, I was able to solve those challenges by going through the previous college classes notes.
This assignment helped me in having a good practice of HTML and CSS. I got to know about the new methods of using and implementing Grid system on a webpage as I made two lists to showcase my work with the help of grids. Additionally, I got the knowledge about using the flexbox with different positions while placing the objects to different places and changing the positions of the elements and objects when a new display layout comes, like Different objects placements for mobile, tablet, desktop view.
I used "Google fonts" to add a font to my website. And used "Google maps" to embed Maps to my contact page of my web Portfolio.
